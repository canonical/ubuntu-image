Image Definition
================

The image definition is a YAML file that is consumed by ``ubuntu-image``
that specifies how to build a classic image.

The following specification defines what is supported in the YAML:

.. code:: yaml

       # The name of the image.
       name: <string>
       # The human readable name to use in the image.
       display-name: <string>
       # An integer used to track changes to the image definition file.
       revision: <int> (optional)
       # The architecture of the image to create.
       architecture: amd64 | armhf | arm64 | s390x | ppc64el | riscv64
       # The Ubuntu codename to use as apt sources. Example: jammy
       series: <string>
       # The classification for this image.
       class: cloud | installer | preinstalled
       # An alternative kernel to install in the image. Normally this
       # is just one kernel and defaults to "linux", but we support
       # installing more than one, since installer images can provide
       # multiple kernels to choose from.
       kernel: <string> (optional)
       # gadget defines the boot assets of an image. When building a
       # classic image, the gadget is optionally compiled as part of
       # the state machine run.
       gadget: (optional)
         # An URI pointing to the location of the gadget tree. For
         # gadgets that need to be built this can be a local path
         # to a directory or a URL to be git cloned. These gadget
         # tree builds will automatically have the environment
         # variables ARCH=<architecture> and SERIES=<series>.
         # The values for these environment variables are sourced
         # from this image definition file. For pre-built
         # gadget trees this must be a local path.
         # The URI must begin with either http://, https://, or file://
         url: <string>
         # The type of gadget tree source. Currently supported values
         # are git, directory, and prebuilt. When git is used the url
         # will be cloned and `make` will be run. When directory is
         # used, ubuntu-image will change directories into the specified
         # URL and run `make`. When prebuilt is used, the contents of the
         # URL are simply copied to the gadget directory.
         type: git | directory | prebuilt
         # A git reference to use if building a gadget tree from git.
         ref: <string> (optional)

         target: <string> (optional)
       # A path to a model assertion to use when pre-seeding snaps
       # in the image. Must be a local file URI beginning with file://

The following sections detail the top-level keys within this definition,
followed by several examples.


name
====

This mandatory meta-data field is not yet used, but must not be blank.
Any characters are permitted, of any (non-zero) length. For example:

.. code:: yaml

    name: ubuntu-server-raspi


display-name
============

This mandatory meta-data field is not yet used, but must not be blank.
Any characters are permitted, of any (non-zero) length. For example:

.. code:: yaml

    display-name: Ubuntu Server for Raspberry Pi


revision
========

This optional meta-data field is not yet used. If specified, it must
be an integer number.


architecture
============

This mandatory field specifies the architecture of the image to be created. It
must be one of the following valid strings:

* amd64
* armhf
* arm64
* s390x
* ppc64el
* riscv64

For example:

.. code:: yaml

    architecture: arm64


series
======

This mandatory field specifies the Ubuntu release name as it should appear in
apt sources. For example, to produce an image for the 20.04 release, this
should be "focal". Example values include:

* bionic
* focal
* jammy
* kinetic

Please consult the `Releases <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases>`_ page for
currently valid release names, but bear in mind that release names must be
specified as they would appear in apt sources, i.e. lower-cased with no numeric
part and no "LTS" suffix.

For example:

.. code:: yaml

    series: jammy


class
=====

This mandatory field specifies the image classification. It is currently
unused, and must be set to the string "preinstalled". In future, the set of
valid strings is intended to be:

* preinstalled
* installer
* cloud

For example:

.. code:: yaml

    class: preinstalled


kernel
======

This optional key specifies an additional kernel to include in the image. If
specified, the value should be a string that represents the name of the
kernel package to be installed.

.. code:: yaml

    kernel: linux-image-generic


gadget
======

This optional field specifies from where the gadget tree will be sourced.
Support is included for prebuilt gadgets, building gadgets from a local
directory, or building gadgets from a git repository. If gadget is not
included in the image definition, but some disk output (img, qcow2, iso)
is included, an error will occur. Gadget should only be excluded if the
only artifact that you will be creating is a rootfs tarball.

Examples
========

Note that not all of these fields are required. An example used to build
Raspberry Pi images is:

.. code:: yaml

       name: ubuntu-server-raspi-arm64
       display-name: Ubuntu Server Raspberry Pi arm64
