This tool is used to build Ubuntu images.  Currently builds Ubuntu Core snap-based
images from model assertions and Ubuntu classic preinstalled images using image definition
files, but it will be generalized to build more (eventually all) Ubuntu images.


# Requirements

Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) is the minimum platform requirement. All
required third party packages are available in the Ubuntu archive.

If you want to run the test suite locally, you should install all the build
dependencies named in the `debian/control` file.  The easiest way to do that
is to run::

    $ sudo apt build-dep ./

from the directory containing the `debian` subdirectory.  Alternatively of
course, you can just install the packages named in the `Build-Depends` field.
